 # Solving AC linear circuits with CircuitKit
  ---
  ## By Riccardo Persello

  In this playground, I'll showcase two basic examples of AC circuits. My CircuitKit library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/persello/CircuitKit).

  We'll begin with a basic voltage divider.

  [Let's start!](Shhhhh!)
